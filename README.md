## Helper tools

- flactional : provides a simple interface for fraction arithmetic
- parcel : web application bundler
- core-js : provides polyfills for ECMAScript features up to 2023
- Regenerator Runtime: transform async functions into code that can run in older browsers that do not natively support them

## Deploy on Netlify

The project is set up for **continuous integration and deployment** with GitHub and Netlify. To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Push your changes to the GitHub repository.
2. Netlify will automatically build and deploy the latest version of the application. (build command: parcel build index.html --no-scope-hoist --dist-dir ./dist)
